## What it does
Ongoing project utilizing sentiment analysis of tweets to forecast stock market pricing
Deep learning model trained on past stock market prices and tweets in the same interval of time, using natural language processing and PyTorch
Uses Twitter API for web scraping and Yahoo Finance stock prices for training data
• A new stock market forecasting model utilizing sentiment analysis and attention mechanism is presented in this paper to forecast AAPL during the COVID-19 pandemic
• Scraped tweets from the Stock investing community Stocktwits and developed a Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe word embeddings to predict whether the tweet is bullish or bearish
• Developed an LSTM with an attention mechanism and sentiments from the text classifier to forecast stock market prices across 2020
• Stock market sentiment analyzer reached accuracy of 74% (5% higher than previous papers) and LSTM model with sentiment analysis and attention mechanism increased R-squared by over 10% from the baseline LSTM
• Accepted into 2021 IEEE 5th Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference on the Big Data track
